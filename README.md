# JNUC2020-311
My script works, now what? Evaluating scripting through a different lens (JNUC311)

# Abstract
Scripts are used by Jamf Pro admins for many purposes, but Jamf Pro admins don’t have to code the script themselves. There are many resources for scripting and Jamf Pro administrators are more supported than ever before. Many communities (like Jamf Nation) exist to provide both new and seasoned admins with powerful additions to their management framework in the form of scripting. This presentation will examine a number of factors about scripts that aren’t always a primary concern of a script-based solution including: How portable is the script? What existing tools does it depend on? How fast is the script? Target Audience: This JNUC presentation is designed for intermediate level Jamf Pro administrators. The ideal attendee is a Jamf administrator that uses scripts within their Jamf Pro server either running them as part of policies or extension attributes or potentially leveraging the APIs and scripting.
